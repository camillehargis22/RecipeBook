3/28/2022: Lifted the states to App.js. I'm not really liking how Recipe is

    then fiddle with it some more.
3/29/2022: Finished lifting the states for the lists, added the Navbar, but
    without the implementation, have not yet done the implementation for

    building up components more to start having the look of the page
4/3/2022: Added common buttons.
4/4/2022: Added description to backend. Built up most of the app to where
    I just need to add functionality and routing (at least as far as I can
    tell so far).

    working as expected.
4/20/2022: Finished working on forms (as far as can tell), but decided
    to comment out anything with the Menu for now because the rest too
    long to complete with forms, but will add back in later. Also
    cleaned up some code.

    and eventually deploy it so I can use it, but for the project,
    it is good enough, and can add to portfolio.
